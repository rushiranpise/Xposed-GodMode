# Xposed-GodMode

## Oh my god what the hell is this?

With ```Xposed``` you can block what you don't like in any app

The current function is similar to AdBlock on the PC side

## Hey this looks really nice what can I do with it?

- Supported
   - [x] Block controls such as ads or ugly buttons

- Expected to support in the future
   - [ ] Support for exporting modified apps
   - [ ] Modify control properties: size/position/text/picture

## Oh that's too bad this is the problem

- Unable to block the controls in the floating window
- Blocking controls in the list can cause confusion

## Correct posture to use



## Guys I think I should tell you something

Due to busy work (excuses), the progress of the project has been slow and failed to be compatible with the new Android version in time, so various inexplicable problems have appeared. In addition, many guys contacted me before, hoping to open source, so after I thought for a long time, I decided that open source is worse than others. Happy, you can file an ```issue``` for any functions that gods want this project.
